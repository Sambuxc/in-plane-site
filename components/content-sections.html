      Yes, I am Stuart K. Taylor, and if you ask me nicely, I might one day tell you what the K stands for.
      I recently decided to take my love of writing into the world of cyberspace; yes, yes I know I am a banana head,
      anyway enough of the humour now, so let’s get this thing done.

      To tell you the truth, I'm not here chasing big numbers, far from it. In fact, if you don’t like the content, it’s
      no bother, I won’t lose any sleep hoping you'll join the party or how many followers I’ve got, I love what I do
      and that’s more than enough.

  <p>
    We meet central character Maurice as he is driving down the M3 from London in his campervan during a nasty summer
    thunderstorm on his way to the south coastal town of Bournemouth. He sings and plays guitar in the street for a
    living, but due to the Londoners giving him a wide berth, he believes working the south coast in the summer is a
    good plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the thunderstorm seems relentless, he decides to pull into the next service station and give himself a serious
    talking to. Sitting at a table in the café area, he fumbles around in his backpack for a pen to make some notes on
    his finances when an elderly lady appears and offers him one.

2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000


## Todos
1. Add slider using new CSS scroll-marker / button property - https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#scroll-marker-button
2. Add scroll-target-group to nav links - https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#scroll-target-group
3. Think about how Nested View Transition Groups could be used for animating open article posts - https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#nested-view-transition-groups
4. Add # to save your place on the page like https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025 page does (so that when reloading the tab you can continue reading from where you left off).
5. When scrolling down, each .heading-1 element should be fixed at the top of the viewport.
